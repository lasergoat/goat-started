A simple boilerplate for React app with api running mongo.

Make sure mongo is installed and the data file is writable - or if you don't want mongo, remove the commands from `package.json`.

There are a few commands to run,

    npm install

    npm start

    #or for putting the public files on a specific port:
    PORT=5477 npm start
